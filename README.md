🔗 **Live Guide**: [Oncology-IG-Kenya](https://steve-macharia.github.io/Oncology-IG-Kenya)

- FHIR profiles for **Diagnosis**, **Staging**, **CarePlan**, **Medication**, and **Encounter**
- Kenyan standards from **SHA**, **KEMRI**, **ICD-10**, and **MOH guidelines**
- A registry-ready structure for cancer reporting and referrals
